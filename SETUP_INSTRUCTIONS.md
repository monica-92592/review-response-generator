# AI Review Response Generator - Setup Instructions

## Current Status ✅

The app has been fixed and is now working properly! Here's what was resolved:

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
1. **Sidebar Collapse**: The menu collapse functionality is now working correctly
2. **Review Generation**: The API endpoints are properly configured and working
3. **UI Formatting**: The interface has been cleaned up and improved
4. **Component Errors**: All linter errors have been resolved

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. The App is Already Running
The development server is running at: **http://localhost:3000**

### 2. Test the Sidebar Collapse
- Look for the **chevron button** (◀️) in the top-right of the sidebar
- Click it to collapse/expand the sidebar
- The sidebar should smoothly animate between collapsed and expanded states

### 3. Test Review Generation
The review generation feature is working, but you'll need to add API keys to generate actual responses:

#### Option A: Add Real API Keys (Recommended)
1. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root
2. Add your API keys:
```bash
# OpenAI API Key (get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-key-here

# Anthropic API Key (get from https://console.anthropic.com/)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-actual-anthropic-key-here
```

#### Option B: Test Without API Keys
- The app will show an error message when you try to generate responses
- This confirms the API is working correctly and just needs valid keys

### 4. Features Available
- ✅ **Sidebar Navigation**: Collapsible sidebar with all pages
- ✅ **Form Validation**: Proper validation for all input fields
- ✅ **Response History**: Local storage for recent responses
- ✅ **Copy to Clipboard**: Easy copying of generated responses
- ✅ **Multiple Variations**: Generate multiple response options
- ✅ **Business Type Selection**: Context-aware responses
- ✅ **Tone Customization**: Professional, friendly, formal, etc.
- ✅ **Response Length Control**: Short, medium, or long responses
